## GitHub Copilot Personal vs. Businesses Use

| Section                                   | Details|
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Free Version (Personal Use Only)**   | - GitHub Copilot Free is designed **only for individual developers**.<br>- It **cannot** be enabled on a managed organization account.<br>- When using the free version, **your code may be used to train GitHub’s AI models**. This is a key privacy consideration for anyone working with sensitive or proprietary code. |
| **Organization Use (Paid Plans)**      | - For companies or teams, GitHub offers **Copilot for Business** and **Copilot for Enterprise**.<br>- These plans are built for enterprise compliance and **do not use your code for training**.<br>- They include additional features like policy controls, audit logs, and enterprise-grade security.                                         |

## Pricing Details

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are the prices as of today. Please make sure to check the current prices here in case anything has changed.

> - [GitHub Enterprise pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/githubenterprise/?msockid=38ec3806873362243e122ce086486339) - Table

> [!TIP]
> - To use these, each user typically needs a **GitHub Enterprise license** (around \$20 per user/month).  
> - `Visual Studio subscribers can often add GitHub Enterprise for $0.12 per user/month, then add Copilot for $19.` Bundle with VS Studio license and GHE applies whether it's an Enterprise or Professional license, as today. More details here [Visual Studio subscriptions pricing](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/?tab=paid-subscriptions), [GitHub Enterprise pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/githubenterprise/?msockid=38ec3806873362243e122ce086486339), [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans)
> - For large deals, GitHub sometimes offers a `1-month free trial`.

## Custom LLM Scenario

- If an organization deploys its own LLM (e.g., in Azure AI Foundry) and integrates it with GitHub Copilot, the assumption is that `code would not be sent to GitHub for training`.  
- However, this depends on the integration method and data flow, so it’s important to `verify GitHub’s documentation and your LLM’s data-handling policies`.

> e.g How to deploy an AI Foundry instance:

> e.g How to deploy an LLM within AI Foundry:

> e.g How to integrate LLMs from AI Foundry within GitHub Copilot

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c993648-8a8d-4b5d-be79-19850aeef593

> [!NOTE]
> - Free Copilot = personal use only + code may be used for training.
> - Org use requires paid plans (Business or Enterprise) = code is **not** used for training.
> - Pricing varies, but expect \$19–\$39 per user/month, with possible discounts for Visual Studio subscribers.
> - For privacy-sensitive environments, confirm data policies when integrating custom LLMs.
