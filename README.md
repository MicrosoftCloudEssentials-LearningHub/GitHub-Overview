## Overview 

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Git | A distributed version control system that tracks changes to files over time |
| Repository (Repo) | A project's folder containing all files and their revision history |
| Branch | A parallel version of the repository for isolated development work |
| Commit | A snapshot of changes with a unique ID and descriptive message |
| Pull Request (PR) | A proposal to merge changes from one branch into another |
| Merge | The process of integrating changes from one branch into another |

## Development Workflow

<details>
<summary><b>1. Create or Clone a Repository</b></summary>

- Initialize a new repository: `git init my-project`
- Clone an existing repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git`
- Public repos visible to everyone, private repos limited to collaborators
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>2. Branch Development</b></summary>

- Create and switch to a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-branch`
- List all branches: `git branch -a`
- Work in isolation without affecting the main codebase
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3. Commit Changes</b></summary>

- Check status of changed files: `git status`
- Stage all changes: `git add .`
- Stage specific file: `git add <file name>`
- Commit staged changes: `git commit -m "<message>"`
- Build a detailed history of project modifications
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>4. Open Pull Request</b></summary>

- Push branch to remote repository: `git push origin <feature-branch name>`
- Use GitHub UI: Click `Compare & pull request`
- Describe changes, their purpose, and impact
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>5. Code Review and Discussion</b></summary>

- Review changes line by line in GitHub UI
- Add comments on specific lines
- Request changes or approve the pull request
- Ensure code quality and catch issues early
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>6. Automated Testing (CI)</b></summary>

- GitHub Actions run automated tests when PR is created
- Example workflow file (.github/workflows/ci.yml):
  ```yaml
  name: CI
  on: [push, pull_request]
  jobs:
    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - run: npm install
        - run: npm test
  ```
- Check test results in `Actions` tab on GitHub
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>7. Merge Approved Changes</b></summary>

- GitHub UI: Click `Merge pull request`
- Or command line:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull
  git merge feature-branch
  git push
  ```
- Features or fixes become part of the official project
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>8. Automated Deployment (CD)</b></summary>

- Deploy updated applications to production environments
- Example deployment workflow:
  ```yaml
  name: Deploy
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main]
  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - run: npm install
        - run: npm run deploy
  ```
- Release new versions to users automatically

</details>


## Issues

> Issues are GitHub's built-in tracking system for bugs, feature requests, and tasks. They provide a centralized location to discuss ideas, enhancements, and problems related to your project.

<details>
<summary><b>Expand for more details</b></summary>

### Key Features
- **Issue Templates**: Create standardized formats for bug reports, feature requests, etc.
- **Labels**: Categorize issues by type, priority, status (e.g., "bug", "enhancement", "high-priority")
- **Milestones**: Group issues into project phases or version releases
- **Assignees**: Delegate responsibility to specific team members
- **Mentions**: Tag team members using @username to request input
- **Task Lists**: Create checklists within issues using `- [ ]` syntax

### Examples

**Creating an issue via GitHub CLI:**
```bash
gh issue create --title "Login button doesn't work" --body "When clicking the login button, nothing happens."
```

**Example issue template:**
```yaml
name: Bug Report
description: File a bug report
body:
  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value: |
        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
  - type: input
    id: what-happened
    attributes:
      label: What happened?
      description: Also tell us, what did you expect to happen?
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: dropdown
    id: browsers
    attributes:
      label: What browsers are you seeing the problem on?
      multiple: true
      options:
        - Firefox
        - Chrome
        - Safari
        - Microsoft Edge
```

**Linking an issue to a pull request:**
```
This PR fixes #123 and addresses #456
```
</details>

## Projects

> Projects are flexible Kanban-style boards for organizing work and tracking progress across GitHub issues and pull requests.

<details>
<summary><b>Expand for more details</b></summary>

### Key Features
- **Boards**: Customizable Kanban-style boards with columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
- **Cards**: Issues, pull requests, or notes that move between columns
- **Automation**: Automatically move cards based on events like PR creation
- **Views**: Table, board, or roadmap views for different perspectives
- **Custom Fields**: Add metadata like priority, effort, or custom categories
- **Filters**: Focus on specific aspects of the project by assignee, label, etc.

### Examples

**Basic project board structure:**
- To Do
- In Progress
- Review
- Done

**Automation rules example:**
- When issues are opened → Add to "To Do" column
- When pull requests are opened → Move card to "In Progress" column
- When pull requests are merged → Move card to "Done" column

**GitHub CLI commands:**
```bash
# Create a new project
gh project create "Q3 Feature Roadmap" --org "your-organization"

# Add an issue to a project
gh project item-add <project-number> --issue <issue-number>
```
</details>

## GitHub Pages
